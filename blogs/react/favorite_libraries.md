## React Navigation

_Utility_

React Navigation is one of the most important libraries for React Native. Almost all apps require some sort of routing and no library does it better than React Navigation. With features such as deep linking, custom transitions, and more, it's no surprise that React Navigation is everyone's favorite choice when it comes to routing.

## Axios

_Utility_

This library needs no explaining and I'm sure you have heard about this before if not already used it yourself. If your application requires any API calls, Axios does it the best.

Note: You can also use Fetch, however I personally prefer Axios as it has more features.

[See it here](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

## AsyncStorage

_Utility_

If you're a web developer then you already know what localStorage is. You can think of AsyncStorage as the same thing. Because mobile apps aren't hosted in a web environment like Chrome, we have to save it somewhere else, thus AsyncStorage is used.

[See it here](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/install/)

## React Native Paper

_UI/UX_

A very popular UI library, React Native Paper provides many useful components right out the box. With additional options for theming such as light/dark mode!

## React Native Elements

_UI/UX_

Another popular UI library, React Native Elements provides many useful components to use. See the difference between React Native Elements and React Native Paper and choose which one you like better, or use both!

## React Native Animatable

One of the most popular libraries for animations, easily add some spice to your application with React Native Animatable's great documentation.
