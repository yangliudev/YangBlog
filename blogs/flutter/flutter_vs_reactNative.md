## Overview

For many people that are new to mobile development they'll encounter the dilemma of having to decide which framework they want to learn. Currently, the two most popular frameworks are Flutter and React Native with the former being developed by Google and the latter being developed by Facebook. Having used both extensively, here are my opinions on them.

## Flutter

Pro

1. Easy to learn and pickup for beginners and people new to the framework. Because the framework was built on widgets, a lot of UI elements are already done for you, helping speed up the process of development.
2. There are lots of libraries available to use [here](https://pub.dev/)
3. Receives continuous updates backed by Google.

Con

1. Quite new to the market, only being introduced in May of 2017! Because of this, there are less resources for it compared to React Native.
2. Although it is nice that a lot of UI elements (widgets) are available to use right out the box, customization for these widgets is a little more tricky.

## React Native

Pros

1. Extremely customizable with full control over styling.
2. Lots of libraries to use
3. Established framework, with React as it's web counterpart. Because of this, there are LOTS of documentation and resources that you can find online.
4. Receives continuous updates backed by Facebook.

Con

1. Harder to learn if you are not coming from a programming background.
