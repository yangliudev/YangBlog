## Overview

For many people that are new to mobile development they'll encounter the dilemma of having to decide which framework they want to learn. Currently, the two most popular frameworks are Flutter and React Native with the former being developed by Google and the latter being developed by Facebook. Having used both extensively, here are my opinions on them.

## Flutter

Pros

1. Easy to learn and pickup for beginners and people new to the framework. Because the framework is built on widgets, a lot of UI elements are already ready to use, helping speed up the process of development.
2. There are lots of libraries available to use [here](https://pub.dev/)
3. Receives continuous updates backed by Google.

Cons

1. Quite new to the market, only being introduced in May of 2017! Because of this, there are less resources for it compared to React Native.
2. Although it is nice that a lot of UI elements (widgets) are available to use right out the box, customization for these widgets is a little more tricky.
3. Code is written in Dart which is a relatively new language with harder to learn syntax.

## React Native

Pros

1. Extremely customizable with full control over styling.
2. Lots of libraries available to use
3. Established framework, with React as it's web counterpart. Because of this, there are LOTS of documentation and resources that you can find online.
4. Code can be written in JavaScript or TypeScript which is amongst the most popular programming languages. Web developers can easily transition with the same language.
5. Receives continuous updates backed by Facebook.

Cons

1. Harder to learn if you are not coming from a programming background.

## Conclusion

Both of these frameworks are really great and you honestly can't go wrong with either. There can only be one winner however and in my subjective opinion, I prefer React Native just a little more. One of the main factors that draw me to React Native is that the language used is JavaScript. This is a really big deal as the vast majority of people would know JavaScript compared to the select few that would know Dart as Dart is ONLY used for Flutter. JavaScript on the other hand is used in almost all web applications.
