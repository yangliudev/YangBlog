Hello world, my name is Yang!

I am a mobile and web developer based in Vancouver.

Some of my favorite frameworks to use for mobile development include React Native and Flutter and on the web side I enjoy using React, Vue, and Angular.

Because I am a visual learner, I really enjoy learning about and designing UI/UX. Some programs that I've used for this are Figma and InkScape with the amazing [dribble](https://dribbble.com/) site for inspiration.

I am also very much interested in game development and am hoping to learn Unity and Unreal Engine sometime soon.

Thanks for stopping by my blog and have a great day! :)
